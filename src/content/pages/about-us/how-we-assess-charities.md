_"The research behind Giving What We Can is outstanding… it ischanging the way we think about aid effectiveness, and providing thebasis for well-grounded advice on donating to fight global poverty.”_
- Peter Singer, Professor of Bioethics at Princeton University

### Evidence-based interventions

Giving What We Can’s mission is to be as rigorous as possible whenrecommending charities to donate to. Our research is decidedlyevidence-based. We draw on the best availableresearch from institutions like [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/),MIT’s [Poverty Action Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/),[Innovations for Poverty Action](http://www.poverty-action.org/),and the [Centre for Global Development](http://www.cgdev.org/),and our [researchteam reviews](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/research/charities-intervention-type) hundreds of peer-reviewed studies.

### <a name="h.5qgjnktl9jcx"></a>Our Framework

When choosing charities, we use a framework to work out how yourdonations can have the biggest impact.

The main criteria we look for when evaluating charities and causesare:

*   **Neglectedness**
*   **Tractability**

*   **Impact**

**Neglectedness** means that the cause area isn’tcurrently being given the attention it deserves relative to itsimportance. This could be for a range of reasons — maybe it isn’tcommercially viable for a big pharmaceutical company to invest in thecure for a particular disease, or maybe donors have a bias to fundlocal causes in developed countries instead of donating overseas.The opposite of neglectedness is _crowdedness_. Someinterventions (that would otherwise score highly on our criteria)are in a crowded field, so you won’t have much impact as a donor if youdonate to them.

For instance, while aid for emergency food aid has increaseddramatically in recent years, basic nutrition such as micronutrientfortification has remained relatively underfunded:

**Tractability** means that we give strongerweight to problems that we can plausibly make good progress on.Tractable problems are more likely to see results, so it’s more likelythat trying to solve them will have a big impact. This doesn’t meanthat we don’t consider difficult problems — we just weigh them upagainst the other criteria. This means we’re less likely to endorsecauses that hinge on a problem that seems impossible to solve, or areally hard problem that wouldn’t make a big impact even if you solvedit. It’s also important to remember that this is always subject tochange. The problem of eradicating smallpox was once totallyintractable, but became tractable after advances in immunology andhealthcare delivery. Another example of an extremely tractableintervention is school-based deworming - where every child gets a pillagainst worms and is free of parasites for at least a few months. Youcan see how efficient this is here:

**Impact** means that the problem affects a lotof people, and is really serious. Treating a disease that causesmillions of people to suffer, or one that is particularly horriblewould probably have a high impact. Take malaria for instance: it is avery big and serious problem. The Global Burden of Disease studyestimates that almost 10% of all deaths of children under 5 globallyare due to malaria:

### <a name="h.d36h05pv7d7k"></a>Examples:

Schistosomiasis is a disease caused by a parasitic worm. It cancause long term kidney and liver damage, it affects millions of people (_impact_) but it’s cheap and easy to treat (_tractability_ ). People whohave been deworming during childhood earn more money later in life.However, it is relatively underfunded (it is part of the so-called‘Neglected Tropical Diseases’). This is one of the reasons that the [SchistosomiasisControl Initiative](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative)  is one of our [Top Charities](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/top-charities).

On the other hand, vaccination of children is a highlycost-effective healthcare intervention. It works really well to preventdiseases like diphtheria, pertussis (or whooping cough), and tetanus(DPT) (_tractability_), and there are thousandsof children who need vaccinations (_impact_). However, we don’trecommend it. Why? Simple — the [GlobalAlliance for Vaccines](http://www.gavi.org/) is already [well-funded](http://www.gavi.org/Funding/Resource-mobilisation/Process/Gavi-pledging-conference-January-2015/),so it’s not _neglected_. In this case, it’s better to donateyour money elsewhere, so you canhave a bigger impact.

### <a name="h.8ggilgqnfgnl"></a>Other considerations

When evaluating a specific charity, we also place a strong premiumon **transparency**. Transparency means that a charityhas a commitment to being open and accountable, to using evidence andreason to inform their decision-making, and is responsive to questionsabout how they operate. Without full transparency, it is difficult foran outside observer to know whether the charity is doing what they saythey’re doing, or to dig deeper into the information that the charityis reporting.

## What we compare

At Giving What We Can, we try to find the charities [which do the most good with your donations](/top-charities).

The research that we conduct is secondary in nature. We don’tconduct primary research ourselves for two reasons. Firstly, we are notcurrently in a good position to do so. But more importantly, we firmlybelieve there is already plenty of information and evidence out there.What we urgently need to do is to tap into it, evaluate it andcommunicate the results.

When it comes to comparing charities, some people focus on thepercentage of donation money charities spend on their overhead costs.But this is only a minor part of what makes charities more or lesseffective. Some types of intervention tend to be much more effectivethan others, even though they might lead to higher overheads (such asresearch into more effective action).

Instead, Giving What We Can compares the good done by giving to oneorganisation as opposed to another. We believe that ultimately, that’swhat really counts: Helping people to the greatest extent possible.When considered like this, the difference between charities is oftenastonishing.

## A top-down approach

Evidence suggests that the biggest variations in effectivenessbetween charities are due to the big picture – the type ofinterventions they undertake.

![](/images/uploads/research.jpg)

Therefore we believe that charity evaluation should start with thebig picture, comparing different areas such as health, education andemergency aid to determine which of these are the most promising. Afterthat, you can compare more promising sub-areas (such as malaria orHIV/AIDS treatment, within health) and then the programmes available inthose sub-areas (such as bednets and antimalarials, for malaria).Finally, we compare particular charities which carry out the bestprogrammes (such as Against Malaria Foundation).

## Comparing different types of charity

The question is how to measure and compare the good done bydifferent charities, especially when they work in such diverse areas.

Different types of intervention do very different things. Charitieswhich promote economic growth can be assessed by the increase inhousehold income per dollar donated. Charities which work to preventclimate change can be assessed by carbon emissions averted per dollar.Part of our research is into ways to [comparethese different types of improvements](/blog/2014-05-22/apples-and-oranges-some-initial-thoughts-comparing-diverse-benefits). To do so, we look at theimpact on people’s happiness and their ability to take control of theirlives.

We currently believe that health interventions are the mosteffective at improving the lives of people in developing countries. Asa result, although we still investigate other areas, healthinterventions are our primary focus.

## Comparing health charities

One useful measure of health interventions is the concept of“Quality-Adjusted Life Year” or QALY (and the related"Disability-Adjusted Life Year" or DALY), which is standard in healtheconomics and used by organisations such as the UK’s National HealthService and the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine inthe USA.

In brief, if an intervention gives one person one extra year of lifeat full health, it gives them one QALY. A year of less than full healthwill be some fraction of a QALY, depending on the severity of theimpairment (measured by things like the person’s ability to move aboutfreely, to care for themselves, and to carry out their usual activitieswithout pain or anxiety).

One of the primary goals of our research into global healthcharities is toidentify which charities will do the most good, measured in QALYs perdollar (or pound, or yen…) donated. However, even though these measuresare very useful to inform our recommendations, it is important tostress that we do not blindly rely on these measures and they can onlyever give rough guidance for which health interventions mightpotentially be very effective. We supplement our analysis with expertopinions and common sense.

## The impact of further donations

Although assessing the cost-effectiveness of existing programs ofintervention should be the starting point for charity research, that isnot the end of the matter. After all, we are not concerned witheffectiveness in the abstract, but with the difference that additionalor marginaldonations would make.

That means we also need to consider the issues like these:

*   If a program is already close to its capacity in terms of thegood it can do, then further funding will just lead to diminishingreturns.
*   There can be a danger that increased charitable aid willencourage other sources of funding to withdraw from the cause, reducingthe good done.
*   Some charities have multiple programs of varying effectiveness.Even if a donation is stated to be for the more effective program, thecharity may respond by shifting “non-earmarked” money from that programto a less effective one. The charities that we recommend often onlycarry out one particular very effective programme.

These are all things which we consider in our research before makingour recommendations.

## Following up

Finally, once we have found particularly effective charities, wefrequently re-assess them, to be sure that we continue to point youtowards the places where your donations can make the most difference.

## Our sources

Our biggest source of information, particularly for determining ourcharity recommendations, is the US charity evaluator [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/). Their rigorous researchmethodology focused on determining the overall good done by programs,combined with a strong commitment to transparency and the resources toinvestigate charities extremely thoroughly, make them an invaluableresource for determining the best charities to donate to.

We generally take into consideration any peer-reviewed researchpublished in reputable journals. Our reports also draw on a number ofprimary sources, among whichare:

*   [The Abdul Latif JameelPoverty Action Lab](http://www.povertyactionlab.org/) – An excellent source of randomized controltrial data on interventions designed to alleviate poverty.
*   [The Disease ControlPriorities in Developing Countries Report (DCP2)](http://www.dcp2.org/main/Home.html) – This providescost effectiveness data on a wide range of health interventions in thedeveloping world.
*   [The World HealthOrganisation WHO-CHOICE guide](http://www.who.int/choice/en/) – A cost-effectiveness report similarin scope to DCP2.
