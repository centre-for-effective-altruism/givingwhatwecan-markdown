### Stories from religious Giving What We Can members

> I joined Giving What We Can because I am a Christian. Taking the pledge is one way that I try to follow Jesus’ command to love my neighbour as myself.
> 
> Jesus teaches us to give radically and generously to the poor – pledging to give 10% helps me strive for this. He also tells us that we should value every single human being as our neighbour – therefore I want to help as many people as possible by giving to the most effective charities.

> Being Jewish has shaped my views on charity. Growing up in day schools, my classmates and I were instilled with our people’s commitment to tikkun olam (repairing the world). We were encouraged to decorate our own tzedaka (charity) boxes, to take them home and donate a portion of our allowance each week. In Bible class, we learned about the tradition of the tithe, about how one tenth of our income belonged not to us, but to those who needed it most. And in Talmud class, we learned the importance of challenging the majority opinion, of demanding error-proof logical argument.

> When I first heard about Giving What We Can—donating 10% of one’s income? using metrics to select the most effective causes?—it sounded like a Jewish organization!

> I am immensely grateful for the overflow of blessings in my life: the travel adventures, the fantastic education, all the delicacies on my dinner table, my friends, my church, my faith. This overflow sometimes makes me want to give away all my money – but then I quickly become lukewarm again.
> 
> For me, the answer to this was joining Giving What We Can: By committing to give 10% until retirement, I have a guarantee that I will at least share a minimal amount of my riches with those who can make better use of them than I do. Also, I am very fond of Giving What We Can's focus on cost-effectiveness: This ensures that my giving is truly about blessing the recipients and not only myself. Joining Giving What We Can was my best decision of recent years.
