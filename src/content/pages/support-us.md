I understand the charity will reclaim 25p of tax on every £1 that I have given.” Please email the Centre for Effective Altruism's [fundraising team](mailto:development@centreforeffectivealtruism.org) in case of any change to this status, or your address for tax purposes.</small>

### COST-EFFECTIVENESS

Given the importance of cost-effectiveness to our mission, we have assessed the effectiveness of donations given to us. According to our best estimates, every $1 invested in Giving What We Can will generate around $60 for the best charities. If you want to see our calculations, please have a look at our [Impact page](/impact), or email [information@givingwhatwecan.org](mailto:information@givingwhatwecan.org).

Most of our current expenditure is on staff, as Giving What We can is beyond the size where it could be run well on a volunteer-only basis.

### CAN DONATING TO GIVING WHAT WE CAN FULFIL PART OF THE 10% PLEDGE?

We do allow donations to Giving What We Can to be part of the 10% pledge, although members are in no way expected to donate to us, and we encourage those who do so to give to other charities as well.
