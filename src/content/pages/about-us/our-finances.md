## Finances

This section contains our accounts and budget, which we make publicly available as part of our commitment to transparency.

Here is a high-level version of our current budget:

The most recent accounts for the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA), our parent charity, are [available here](/files/cea_2014_annual_report.pdf). These accounts summarise not only Giving What We Can’s spending, but all spending by CEA. They cover the fiscal year ending 30 June 2014 and were approved by an independent examiner, who inspected our financial records. CEA’s accounts for the previous financial year are [available here.](/files/merged_document_2.pdf)

A more detailed summary of Giving What We Can’s spending over the past year and a half is included in the table below:
